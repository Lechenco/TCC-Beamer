	abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important noninvasive tools for the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia. Automatic beat classification in ECG is a topic of continuing research. In this paper, automatic classification of 3 beat types - normal sinus rhythm, premature ventricular contraction and left bundle branch block is implemented. QRS detection is done using the Pan Tompkins algorithm. Wavelet decomposition using daubechies 4 wavelet is done. 25 features are extracted for each beat from wavelet analysis, namely - mean, variance, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of detail coefficients and of approximation coefficients. 3 RR interval features are also extracted for each beat. Beat classification is implemented by using OAO (One Against One) SVM (Support Vector Machine). 3 SVM's are designed and final grouping is done by maximum voting. Novel method of feature selection is introduced. Feature selection for a particular SVM is done based on the beats to be classified by that SVM. ECG signals are obtained from the open source MIT-BIH cardiac arrhythmia database. 6355 beats (2036 LBB, 3865 N, 454 PVC) are used for testing the implementation. Accuracy of 98.46\%, 98.47\% and 99.92\% are obtained for left bundle branch block, normal and premature ventricular contraction beats respectively.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology for the development of multi-classifiers SVM with One-Againts-One (OAO), which allows each node to use different features or attributes to differentiate each pair of classes, called asymmetric OAO-SVM. We evaluated this method by developing a classification system to identify four types of arrhythmias (Atrial Fibrillation, Atrial Flutter, Supraventricular Tachyarrhythmia and Ventricular Tachycardia) and Normal ECG, using nonlinear characteristics such as Shannon entropy and Lempel-Ziv complexity.This method presents a positive prediction of 90.72\% which represent an improve with respect a typical multi-classifier OAO-SVM.},

A neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM) were implemented for real time detection of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), and they were compared in terms of accuracy. In the feature extraction step a Fast Wavelet Transform (FWT) was used; which was analyzed using the time-frequency characteristics of energy in each sub-band frequency. For the training and validation algorithms, signals from MIT-BIH database with normal sinus rhythm, VF and VT in a time window of 2 seconds were used. Validation results achieve test accuracy of 99.46\% by ANN and SVM in VT/VF detection.},
